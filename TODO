ARCHITECTURE

rename 'data' as it is now to 'json' 

model has array called DB and methods like 'all' and 'first(int)' that return items (rows) from DB

model has to_cells method that does title_elem + this.db.map(function(row){return row.to_cell()})
DB item has to_cell (passed in by model at creation time) that makes a cell.

model has make method that takes in json and returns DB
or
model calls json.asdf.arraypart.map(f) where f returns an DB

Cell is a template - takes in an object and makes html/events

a cell has a title, html and classes. it doesn't have a created_on. 

each DB item (row) from a given model can be unique but should have created_on (standard column)

NO CONTROLERS - the way it is now if you want two twitter grids you'd have to copy and paste the 
instantiation call. no state outside of instantiation laaame. 


GOAL - return items that act like arrays but have special methods

model.first(10).to_cells()
model.first(10).get('created_on')

	is this better than just using map?
